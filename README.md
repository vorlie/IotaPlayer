## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vorlie/IotaPlayer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd IotaPlayer
    ```
3. **Make virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ./venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
  (To install using git, you must install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).)
    ```bash
    py -m pip install PyQt5==5.15.10
    py -m pip install pygame==2.6.0
    py -m pip install git+https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence.git@master
    py -m pip install mutagen==1.47.0
    py -m pip install pynput==1.7.7
    py -m pip install matplotlib
    py -m pip install git+https://github.com/vorlie/PyQtDarkTheme.git@main --ignore-requires-python
    ```

4. **Ensure you have the necessary environment variables and configuration files:**
    - Create a `config.json` file with necessary configuration details.
        - Otherwise the application will generate a default configuration.
    - Add your Discord client ID in the appropriate place if needed.
        - The default value is `1150680286649143356`.

5. **Building from source using pyinstaller:**

      ```
    - If you want console output:
      - Change the `console` value to `True` in the `IotaPlayerWIN.spec` file. If you decide to leave it as `False`, then be aware of how PyInstaller works, it can trigger your anti virus.
        ```spec
          exe = EXE(
            pyz,
            a.scripts,

    ```json
      {
          "discord_comments": {
              "1": "Connect to Discord? If set to true, application will try to connect to discord in order to set your presence.",
              "2": "Set it to false if you don't want to connect to Discord.",
              "3": "The default value is 'true'.",
              "4": "Enter your Discord Client ID. You can find it in your Discord Developer Portal.",
              "5": {
                  "1":"Enter your Discord Large Image Key. You can find it in your Discord Developer Portal.",
                  "2":"You can use links as well.",
                  "3":"The default value is 'default_image'."
              }
          },
          "connect_to_discord": true,
          "discord_client_id": "1150680286649143356",
          "large_image_key": "default_image",
          "use_playing_status": false,

          "root_playlist_folder_comment": {
              "1": "Specify the directory where your playlists are saved. You can change this path if needed.",
              "2": "The default value is 'playlists'."
          },
