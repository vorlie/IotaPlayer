  - **From Source:** You can also run it from the source code by following the Linux instructions below, ensuring you have Python 3.12+ and all required dependencies.

### Linux (and other platforms)

No pre-built binaries are provided for Linux due to the variety of distributions. You must install from source.

**1. System Requirements:**

  - **Python 3.12 or newer.**
  - **GStreamer:** Required for audio playback.
  - **PyQt5:** For the user interface.

**2. Install System Dependencies (Example for Ubuntu/Debian):**

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qtmultimedia \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav \
  libxcb-xinerama0
```

> **Note:** You may need to install other packages depending on your distribution. Refer to the [Troubleshooting](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23troubleshooting) section for help with potential Qt errors.

**3. Clone the Repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vorlie/IotaPlayer.git
cd IotaPlayer
```

**4. Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**5. Install Python Dependencies:**

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --ignore-requires-python
```

**6. Run the Application:**

```sh
python main.py
```

-----

## Usage

1.  **Launch the application** using the executable or by running `python main.py`.
2.  **Manage Playlists:** Use the UI buttons to load, create, or delete playlists.
3.  **Control Playback:** Use the on-screen controls or your keyboard's media keys.
4.  **Customize:** Open the **Settings** dialog to configure Discord integration, accent colors, and other options.

-----

## Playlist Maker

The `PlaylistMaker` is a built-in tool for creating and managing your `.json` playlists.

### How to Use

1.  **Open Existing Playlist:** Click to load and edit an existing `.json` playlist file.
2.  **Select Folder:** Automatically add all compatible audio files from a folder. Songs must follow the naming scheme below for metadata to be recognized.
3.  **Add Songs Manually:** Fill in the fields and click "Add Song" to add a single track.
4.  **Edit & Delete:** Double-click a song in the list to edit it. Select a song and press the `Delete` key to remove it.
5.  **Save Playlist:** Enter a playlist name, add an optional cover image link, and click "Save Playlist".

### Naming Scheme for Auto-Recognition

For the "Select Folder" feature to work best, your files should be named like this:
`Artist - Title [YouTube ID].mp3`

**Examples:**

  - `Artist - Title [dQw4w9WgXcQ].mp3`
  - `Artist (feat. Other) - Title (Remix) [abcdef12345].mp3`

-----

## Configuration

You can configure Iota Player via the in-app **Settings** menu. These settings are stored in `config.json`. The file is created automatically with default values if it doesn't exist.

### `config.json` Example

```json
{
    "connect_to_discord": true,
    "discord_client_id": "1150680286649143356",
    "large_image_key": "default_image",
    "use_playing_status": false,
    "root_playlist_folder": "playlists",
    "default_playlist": "default",
    "colorization_color": "automatic",
    "volume_percantage": 100,
    "google_client_secret_file": "path/to/client_secret.json"
}
```

### Google API Setup (for YouTube Upload)

To use the YouTube playlist upload feature, you need to set up Google API credentials. For full instructions, please see the [**GOOGLE.md**](GOOGLE.md) guide.

## Troubleshooting

  - **Codec Errors:** On Windows, some `.mp3` files may fail to play if they have long ID3 tags. This can cause errors like `DirectShowPlayerService::doRender: Unresolved error code 80040266`. Installing a codec pack like [K-Lite](https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm) usually resolves this. On Linux, ensure you have installed all the `gstreamer1.0-plugins-*` packages listed in the installation section.

  - **Python Version:** This app requires **Python 3.12 or newer**. Verify your version with `python3 --version`.

  - **Qt Platform Errors (Linux):** If you see `xcb` or other platform plugin errors, you may need to install additional libraries:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb1 libx11-xcb1 libgl1-mesa-glx
    ```

    If you are using Wayland, you can try forcing the platform to XCB before running the app:

    ```sh
    export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb
    python main.py
    ```

  - **Check Logs:** For detailed error information, check the `combined_app.log` file in the application directory.

-----

## Shortcuts

  - **Delete Playlist:** Select a playlist and press `Delete`.
  - **Delete Song (in Playlist Maker):** Select a song and press `Delete`.
  - **Media Keys:**
      - **Play/Pause:** `Media Play/Pause` (e.g., FN + F7)
      - **Next Track:** `Media Next` (e.g., FN + F6)
      - **Previous Track:** `Media Previous` (e.g., FN + F5)

-----

## Advanced

### Logging

Logging is configured in `musicPlayer.py`. By default, logs are output to both the console and a rotating file named `combined_app.log`. You can uncomment different logging configurations in the source code if needed.

### Building from Source

If you wish to build a standalone `.exe` file on Windows:

1.  **Install PyInstaller:**
    ```sh
    pip install pyinstaller==6.6.0
    ```
2.  **Build the Executable:**
    ```sh
    pyinstaller IotaPlayerWIN.spec
    ```
    > You can set `console=True` in the `.spec` file to create a build with a command-line console for debugging.
