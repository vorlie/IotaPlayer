File Renamer Utility

This script is designed to clean and rename files within a specified directory. 
It is particularly useful for standardizing file names and removing unwanted characters or trailing numbers.

Features:
- Replaces special characters (like arrows) with hyphens.
- Retains only standard US keyboard characters and common symbols.
- Removes extra spaces from file names.
- Strips trailing numbers before file extensions.

Usage:
1. Set the `directory` variable to the path of the directory containing the files you want to rename.
2. Run the script to process and rename all `.mp3` files in that directory.

Customization:
- The `clean_text` function currently retains standard US keyboard characters and common symbols. If you need to allow additional special characters, modify the regular expression in `clean_text` function accordingly.
- For example, to include more symbols, add them to the character class `[^A-Za-z0-9\s!@#$%^&*()_+=\-\[\]{}|\\;:\'",.<>/?`~]` in the `re.sub()` function.

Note: 
Ensure that you have proper backups of your files before running this script as it will rename files in the specified directory.
